# VSCode Bazel + Jest Integration

## Overview

Run your Jest tests in VSCode.

## Usage

Run, Watch, and Debug buttons will appear above all `describe` and `it` blocks. Clicking on them will run the correct bazel command for that block in the vscode terminal.

Note: the bazel command may fail due to the test working yet.
